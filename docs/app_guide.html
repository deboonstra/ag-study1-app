<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>When the web application is launched from <em>Improving agricultural
injury surveillance: comparing injuries captured Iowa’s Workers’
Compensation and trauma registry data</em>, one will be initially
directed to a couple of user guides. The first guide, titled <em>Web
Application User Guide</em> is this current page, provides a quick
overview of the modeling framework and a detailed description of the
inner workings of the application. Navigate to the <em>Modeling
Framework</em> tab for see a more detailed description of the model
construction and the calculations of the predicted probabilities. Access
to the web application can be found in the <em>Web Application</em> tab.
This application loads a <a href="https://shiny.posit.co">Posit
Shiny</a> application that calculates the predicted probabilities of
being in Iowa’s Workers’ Compensation database and Iowa’s Trauma
Registry. Remaining information in this guides provides details on how
the web application works. First, a quick overview of the model used to
calculate the predicted probabilities is provided to enhance the
understanding of the application basics.</p>

<div id="model-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Model overview</h2>
<hr />
<p>We developed a logistic regression model to probabilistically predict
which data source captured an injured person, given their injury
characteristics and demographics. The predictive model used explanatory
variables found in both data sources: age, gender, injury cause, and
injury nature, and modeled the event that an injured person’s
information was recorded in the Workers’ Compensation data. For
categorical predictors (gender, injury cause, and injury nature), we
used effects coding instead of reference coding, so the average effect
would be zero.</p>

<h2>Application launch</h2>
<hr />
<p>The <em>Web Application</em> tab launches the application to
calculate the predicted probabilities of being in Iowa’s Workers’
Compensation database and Trauma Registry. The application has two
panels. The left panel receives the input from the user, while the right
panel displays the results based on the information given. For this
application, predicted probabilities are calculated based on sex, age,
and cause and nature of the injury. The starting values for sex, cause
of injury, and nature of the injury are <strong><em>Average of
effect</em></strong>. This value is a by-product of effects coding in
the modeling framework, allowing probabilities to be calculated while
averaging all the possible values for the predictors. So, at any time,
if one wants to obtain a predicted probability or a set of predicted
probabilities while considering an average effect of a categorical
variable, then select the <strong><em>Average of effect</em></strong>
option for the variable of interest. Initially, the age of a person’s is
excluded in the probability calculation.</p>

<h2>Application Useage</h2>
<hr />
<div id="user-inputs" class="section level3">
<h3>User inputs</h3>
<p>The left panel of the application takes a select set of inputs from
the user. There is a drop-down menu of all possible choices for the
categorical variables (sex, cause of injury, and nature of injury). For
the purpose of exploring the user inputs, consider the following
example. Suppose one is interested in finding the predicted probability
that a male who fell and fractured his arm is in the workers’
compensation database. Then, all one would need to do is select
<strong><em>Male</em></strong> in the <strong>Sex</strong> drop-down
menu, <strong><em>Falls</em></strong> in the <strong>Cause of
Injury</strong> drop-down menu, and
<strong><em>Fractures/dislocation/sprains/strains</em></strong> in the
<strong>Nature of Injury</strong> drop-down menu. Age is the only
quantitative variable in the model and application. For specifying age,
there are two age sliders titled <strong>Minimum</strong> and
<strong>Maximum Age</strong> and a checkbox denoting whether age should
be included in the probability calculation. If age is of interest, then
there are several points to consider. First, the <strong><em>Include age
in calculation of predicted probabilities</em></strong> checkbox must be
selected. Second, the minimum and maximum age must be set to some value
within the range of possible ages. By default, the minimum and maximum
ages are set to 45, the mean and median age of the combined data
sources. Suppose the two age sliders are assigned to different values,
and the checkbox indicating whether multiple predicted probabilities
should be calculated is not marked. In that case, the age used is the
average of the minimum and maximum age selected. Next, to obtain a range
of predicted probabilities over various ages, the <strong><em>Calculate
multiple predicted probabilities</em></strong> checkbox must be
selected, and the minimum and maximum ages must differ. The application
will flip the two ages assigned in the background if the minimum age
exceeds the maximum. Combining all the above steps for specifying injury
characteristics and demographics will provide predicted probabilities
specific to those characteristics of interest.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Regardless of the injury characteristics and demographics specified
in the user input panel, the results section (right panel) will have the
same general setup. There will be columns denoting the data source of
the injury case (<code>Source</code>), sex (<code>Sex</code>), cause of
injury (<code>Cause</code>), nature of injury (<code>Nature</code>), age
(<code>Age</code>), predicted probability (<code>Probability</code>),
and <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> Wald confidence interval
(<code>LB</code> and <code>UB</code>). By default, sex, age, cause, and
nature of the injury will have empty fields. This occurs because the
categorical variables have initial values of <strong><em>Average of
effect</em></strong>, and age is not denoted to be included in the
calculation. Probabilities for Iowa’s Workers’ Compensation database
(<code>Workers&#39; compensation</code>) and Trauma Registry
(<code>Trauma registry</code>) are displayed for each probability
calculation. As injury characteristics and demographics are defined,
their associated columns in the results section will be filled in, and
the probabilities (predicted and confidence interval) will be
updated.</p>

<h2>On-device useage of web application</h2>
<hr />
<p>Currently, the web application does not allow the user to download
the predicted probabilities calculated. Therefore, to obtain the
probabilities for external use, installation of the <a href="https://github.com/deboonstra/agstudy1app"><code>agstudy1app</code></a>
package is required. Then, simply call the
<code>agstudy1app::pred_prob()</code> function with the injury
characteristics of interest. If one choose to run the web application on
their local machine, they will need to <code>git clone</code> the <a href="https://github.com/deboonstra/agstudy1app"><code>agstudy1app</code></a>
repository to their desired location. Then, in an interactive session of
<em>R</em>, where <code>agstudy1app</code> is the current working
directory, execute the following command.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>agstudy1app::app()</code></pre>
