<h2>Model overview</h2>
<hr />
<p>We developed a logistic regression model to probabilistically predict
which data source captured an injured person, given their injury
characteristics and demographics. The predictive model used explanatory
variables found in both data sources: age, gender, injury cause, and
injury nature, and modeled the event that an injured person’s
information was recorded in the Workers’ Compensation (WC) data. For
categorical predictors (gender, injury cause, and injury nature), we
used effects coding instead of reference coding, so that the average
effect would be zero. To demonstrate how effect parameterization works,
consider the variable sex, which has two levels (male and female).
Different from reference coding, effects coding uses two parameters
<span class="math inline">\(\left(\beta^{S}_{M} \text{ and
}\beta^{S}_{F}\right)\)</span> to characterize the effect of sex. What
allows one to “average over” the sex effect is that effect
parameterization assumes that <span class="math display">\[\beta^{S}_{M}
+ \beta^{S}_{F} = 0.\]</span> As seen in the accompanied paper,
<em>Improving agricultural injury surveillance: comparing injuries
captured Iowa’s Workers’ Compensation and trauma registry data</em>, to
this web application the estimated sex effects are 0.3959 for females
and -0.3959 for males, which sums to zero, as one would hope. The
logistic regression model implemented this parameterization for the
other categorical predictors (cause and nature of the injury). Cause of
injury has a total of 8 levels and nature of injury has 6 levels which
means <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{j = 1}^{8}\beta^{C}_{j} &amp;= 0 \text{ and} \\
\sum_{k = 1}^{6}\beta^{N}_{k} &amp;= 0,
\end{aligned}
\]</span> just as shown with the predictor sex.</p>

<h2>Computation of predicted probabilities</h2>
<hr />
<p>Based on the predictive model, we estimated the probabilities of an
agricultural injury being captured in either the trauma registry or
workers’ compensation repositories. Using the above notation: let <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\alpha}\)</span> denote the estimate of the
model intercept term, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}^{A}\)</span> denote the estimate for
age effect, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\cdot}\)</span> denote
the estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\beta^{S}_{i},
\beta^{C}_{j}, \text{ and } \beta^{N}_{k}\)</span>. Then, the
probability that an injury case is predicted to be in Iowa’s statewide
workers’ compensation database is <span class="math display">\[\hat{\pi}(\mathbf{x}) =
\frac{\exp\left(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}^{S}_{M}x^{S}_{M} +
\hat{\beta}^{S}_{F}x^{S}_{F} + \hat{\beta}^{C}_{1}x^{C}_{1} + \ldots +
\hat{\beta}^{C}_{8}x^{C}_{8} + \hat{\beta}^{N}_{1}x^{N}_{1} + \ldots +
\hat{\beta}^{N}_{6}x^{N}_{6} + \hat{\beta}^{A}x^{A}\right)}{1 +
\exp\left(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}^{S}_{M}x^{S}_{M} +
\hat{\beta}^{S}_{F}x^{S}_{F} + \hat{\beta}^{C}_{1}x^{C}_{1} + \ldots +
\hat{\beta}^{C}_{8}x^{C}_{8} + \hat{\beta}^{N}_{1}x^{N}_{1} + \ldots +
\hat{\beta}^{N}_{6}x^{N}_{6} + \hat{\beta}^{A}x^{A}\right)},\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> are the injury
characteristics and demographics of interest. As an example, suppose the
probability that an injury to a 45 year old male who fell and fractured
a bone is in the workers’ compensation database is of interest. Then,
<span class="math display">\[\hat{\pi}(\mathbf{x}_{0}) =
\frac{\exp\left[\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}^{S}_{M} + \hat{\beta}^{C}_{2}
+ \hat{\beta}^{N}_{1} + \hat{\beta}^{A}(45)\right]}{1 +
\exp\left[\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}^{S}_{M} + \hat{\beta}^{C}_{2} +
\hat{\beta}^{N}_{1} + \hat{\beta}^{A}(45)\right]},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x^{S}_{M} = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^{C}_{2} = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^{N}_{1} = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^{A} = 45\)</span>, and remaining <span class="math inline">\(x_{0}\)</span>’s are zeo. The probability this
injury will be located in Iowa’s trauma registry is simply <span class="math inline">\(1- \hat{\pi}(\mathbf{x}_{0})\)</span>. Now if one
only has the age of a person, effects coding allows for “averaging over”
the effects of sex, cause of injury, and nature of injury in the
calculation of the predicted probability. The chance this person is in
WC is <span class="math display">\[\hat{\pi}(\mathbf{x}) =
\frac{\exp\left(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}^{A}x^{A}\right)}{1 +
\exp\left(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}^{A}x^{A}\right)}.\]</span></p>
